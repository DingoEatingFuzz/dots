# dots.

These are my dotfiles. I try to keep things light, so there isn't much to see here.

### Bash and such

Just some aliases and functions I have picked up along the way. Mostly catered to reducing keystrokes. Also some special stuff for Ember. Nothing major.

### Git

A couple aliases and basic configuration.

### Macos

A script to take some of the annoying training wheels and guardrails off of macos.

### Vim

A collection of plugins and plugin configuration that I am hoping will work for me as I switch off of vscode.
